# Pythagorean Triplet

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000. Find the product a * b * c.

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, {a, b, c}, for
which,

a**2 + b**2 = c**2

For example, 3**2 + 4**2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5**2.

You will need the Minitest gem. To install it, open a
